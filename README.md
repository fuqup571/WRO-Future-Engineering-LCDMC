## Mobility Management

The robot uses d12 wpl as its basic structure and is equipped with jetson orin nano and self-designed 3D printed parts to further enhance the structure and additional functions. It also has a differential to ensure power is transferred evenly to all four wheels.

In order to provide sufficient power while maintaining a low center of gravity, a powerful RC servo motor is used, which is connected to the steering shaft through 3D printed parts and gears. Ackermann steering geometry is used to turn, helping to achieve a compact and stable overall body. structure.
